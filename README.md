🧮 stock_basic.cpp — In-Memory Product Manager

A lightweight and beginner-friendly C++ console application that helps manage product stock entirely in memory.
This version allows users to add, list, and calculate the total value of all products currently registered.

It’s a great introduction to structured programming in C++, showcasing:

🧱 Use of structs to represent products (name, price, quantity)

🔢 Handling of arrays to store multiple items

🧠 Core programming concepts like loops, functions, and conditionals

🖥️ A text-based menu interface for user interaction

⚡ Perfect for students learning the fundamentals of C++ and data handling without file storage.

💾 stock_database.cpp — Persistent Product Manager with CSV Database

An enhanced and more robust C++ inventory management system that adds file persistence to store product data permanently using a CSV database (Database.csv).
It supports complete product lifecycle management, including add, consult, update, and delete operations.

This version demonstrates intermediate C++ concepts, such as:

📂 File handling with ifstream and ofstream for reading/writing product data

🧩 Use of stringstream for parsing CSV lines efficiently

🆔 Automatic ID assignment for each product and status tracking (A = Active, D = Deleted)

🔁 Menu-driven interface with dynamic product updates

🧾 Persistent storage that saves changes between program runs

🚀 Ideal for learning how to connect C++ programs with real data files and simulate a small database system.
